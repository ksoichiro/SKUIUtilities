This is a library for iOS apps to manipulate UI programatically.  
I know building UI in code is not the best practice but
there are some apps built UI without Interface Builder and Storyboards
and this library aims to support them.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

* iOS 6

## Installation

SKUIUtilities is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
